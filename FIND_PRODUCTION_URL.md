# 🔍 Find Your Production URL

## Your Current URL (Preview):
`https://cec-m0gdzdfqz-bayder-bassims-projects.vercel.app/`

This is a **preview deployment**, not the production URL!

## ✅ How to Find Your Production URL:

### Method 1: Check Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Click on your project: **CEC**
3. Look at the top of the page - you should see:
   - **"Production"** with a URL like: `https://cec.vercel.app` or `https://cec-xxxxx.vercel.app`
   - This is your **public production URL** ✅

### Method 2: Check Deployments Tab

1. In your project, go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Find the deployment that says **"Production"** (not Preview)
3. Click on it
4. Copy the URL shown - this is your production URL

### Method 3: Check Project Settings

1. Go to **Settings** → **Domains**
2. You should see your production domain listed there

## 🎯 What Your Production URL Should Look Like:

- ✅ `https://cec.vercel.app` (if you have a custom domain)
- ✅ `https://cec-xxxxx.vercel.app` (Vercel auto-generated)
- ❌ NOT: `https://cec-m0gdzdfqz-bayder-bassims-projects.vercel.app` (this is preview)

## 📝 If You Don't See a Production URL:

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Find your latest deployment
3. Click the **"..."** menu (three dots)
4. Select **"Promote to Production"**

This will make it your production deployment!

3. Share it with students!
