### Step 3: Configure & Deploy

## 📝 Important Notes:

1. **Admin Panel:** Adding courses through admin panel won't save permanently (serverless limitation)
   - Courses will reset when the server restarts
   - For permanent storage, we'd need a database (can be added later)

2. **Initial Courses:** The 6 sample courses are included and will show

3. **Custom Domain:** You can add your own domain later in Vercel settings

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

- **Build Fails?** Check the error message in Vercel dashboard
- **Missing Files?** Make sure all files are pushed to GitHub (check your repo)
- **Need Help?** The error logs in Vercel dashboard are very helpful

**That's it! Your website should be live in 2 minutes!** 🎉
