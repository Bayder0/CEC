# ⚙️ Git Setup - Quick Steps

## Step 1: Configure Git (Do this first!)

Open your terminal/command prompt and run these commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Replace:**
- `"Your Name"` with your actual name (e.g., "Bayder Bassim")
- `"your.email@example.com"` with your GitHub email

**Example:**
```bash
git config --global user.name "Bayder Bassim"
git config --global user.email "bayder@example.com"
```

---

## Step 2: After Git is configured, I'll help you push!

Once you've run those commands, tell me:
1. ✅ "Done, I've configured Git"
2. Your GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo-name`)

Then I'll help you push all the code to GitHub!

## Step 3: Push to GitHub

After you've configured Git, I'll give you commands to:
- Connect to your GitHub repo
- Push all your code
- Deploy on Vercel

**Quick Tip:** If you want, you can also just run:
```bash
git config user.name "Bayder Bassim"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
```
(without --global, just for this project)
